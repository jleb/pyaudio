    Thanks to Michael Graczyk for submitting a patch!

  - Add a few automated unit tests.

  PyAudio 0.2.9

  - Fix overflow error handling logic for pa_read_stream.

    Stream.read takes an additional parameter that specifies whether
    an exception is raised on audio buffer overflow, for parity with
    Stream.write.  Includes relevant bug fixes in the C module logic.

    Thanks to Tony Jacobson for submitting a patch!

  - Fix IOError arguments.

    IOError exceptions previously had values in the strerror and errno fields
    swapped, which is now corrected.

    Thanks to Sami Liedes for the report!

  - Miscellaneous updates.

    Python library surfaces issues with importing low-level C module.
    Code formatting update.
    Updates to examples for Python 3 compatibility.

  PyAudio 0.2.8

  - Device names: support non-UTF8 encoded device names.

    get_device_info_by_index() now attempts to decode the device name
    using a few known encodings (defaults to UTF-8 and CP1252).  If
    those fail, PyAudio passes the raw bytes for the device name.
    Previously, PyAudio assumed a UTF-8 encoding, which is not always
    true.

  - Callback-mode: fix deadlock on some platforms when calling
    pa.stop_stream.

    Thanks to Jason Roehm for this patch!

  PyAudio 0.2.7

  - Callback-mode: support callables.

    Thanks to John Luebs and Bastian Bechtold for this patch.

  - Update documentation to use Sphinx.

    Thanks again to Bastian Bechtold for his incredible contribution!

  PyAudio 0.2.6

  - Added support for Python 3.  As of this update, PyAudio is
    compatible with Python 2.6, Python 2.7, and Python 3.2.

    Many thanks to Bastian Bechtold and Bob Jamison for their patches!

  - Fixed a bug in which a list could be modified during iteration.

    Many thanks to Danilo J. S. Bellini for reporting this error!

  - Fixed a memory bug involving Mac OS X channel maps.

  PyAudio 0.2.5

  - Added support for callback (non-blocking) operation.

    Many thanks to Bastian Bechtold for his initial contribution and
    his generous help towards releasing this feature.  Callback mode
    would not have happened without Bastian's help!


2010-08-12  Hubert Pham  <hubert@mit.edu>

  PyAudio 0.2.4

  - Maintenance release: updated directory structure and packaging.


2008-10-29  Hubert Pham  <hubert@mit.edu>

  PyAudio 0.2.3

  - Release the GIL during blocking PortAudio I/O calls.

  - Fixed Python argument parsing to use a long for PaSampleFormat
    (rather than int).

    Thanks to many who have pointed out these two issues and sent
    patches.

  - pyaudio.PyAudio.is_format_supported() now throws a ValueError
    exception if the specified format is not supported for any reason
    (or returns True if the format is supported).

    Prior, the method would return False if and only if the specified
    sample rate was unsupported. is_format_supported() now will always
    return True or throw an exception.


2008-03-06  Hubert Pham <hubert@mit.edu>

  PyAudio 0.2.0

  - Added PaMacCoreStreamInfo for Mac OS X Host API Specific Stream Info
    (e.g., for channel maps).

  - Added packaging files for building binaries.


2008-02-12  Justin Mazzola Paluska  <jmp@mit.edu>

  - Initial version of debian packaging.
