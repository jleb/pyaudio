PyAudio v0.2.0 Compilation Hints
======================================================================

Here are some hints for compiling PortAudio and PyAudio on various
platforms:

    * General UNIX Guide: (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin)
    * Microsoft Windows (native)

Generally speaking, you must first install the PortAudio v19 library
first before building PyAudio.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Build and install PortAudio, i.e.:

   % ./configure
   % make
   % make install # you may need to be root

   (Or better yet, use your package manager to install PortAudio v19)

2. Extract PyAudio; to build and install, run:

   % python setup.py install


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are targeting native Win32 Python, you will need either
Microsoft Visual Studio or MinGW (via Cygwin). Here are compilation
hints for using MinGW under the Cygwin build environment.

Note: I've only tested this under Cygwin's build environment. Your
mileage may vary in other environments (i.e., compiling PortAudio with
MinGW's compiler and environment).

(If you have instructions for building PyAudio using Visual Studio,
I'd love to hear about it.)

1. Download PortAudio to portaudio-v19/ and build; when running
   configure, be sure to use ``-mno-cygwin`` (under cygwin) to
   generate native Win32 binaries:

     % CFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" LDFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" ./configure
     % make

2. Untar PyAudio in the same (parent) directory that contains your
   PortAudio directory. For example, if your PortAudio v19 directory
   is ~/portaudio-v19/, then the PyAudio source should be in
   ~/pyaudio-0.2.0/

3. To build PyAudio, from inside the pyaudio-0.2.0/ directory, run:

     % python setup.py build --static-link -cmingw32

   The --static-link option statically links in the PortAudio
   library to the PyAudio module, which is probably the best
   way to go on Windows.

4. To install PyAudio:

     % python setup.py install --skip-build

   The --skip-build option prevents Python from searching your system
   for Visual Studio and the .NET framework.
